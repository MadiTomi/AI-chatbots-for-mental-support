Важно обратиться за профессиональной помощью, чтобы разобраться в корнях вашей тревожности и научиться управлять ей. Психотерапевт может предложить вам конкретные методы и стратегии, которые помогут снизить уровень тревоги, такие как когнитивно-поведенческая терапия. Также может быть полезно установить регулярный режим дня, включая время для отдыха и релаксации. Не забывайте о важности физической активности, которая способствует улучшению настроения и снижению тревожности.\n"
